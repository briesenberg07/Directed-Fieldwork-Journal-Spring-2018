**KEY:**

**\#a: Learning Outcome**

**\#b: Project/Task Description**

**\#c: Evidence/Criteria for Evaluation**

**1a**

**Gain experience in the evaluation of materials with preservation needs and in selecting items appropriate for digitization**

**1b**

**In collaboration with a Preservation Librarian and U.S. Documents Librarian, assess a variety of government documents referred to Preservation Services due to physical deterioration. From among these, select items to digitize \(not to exceed a total page count of approx. 1,500 pages\). Criteria for selection will include physical condition as well as subject matter and potential value to researchers and other users now and in the future. Considerations may also include the value of digitizing materials created by historically underrepresented populations, or with topical coverage that seems especially timely, such as items relating to social welfare programs, the prison system, or other areas.**

**1c**

**A list of materials for digitization should be agreed on by all stakeholders. The DFW participant should articulate the reasons for selection in DFW course artifacts and/or other deliverables.**

**2a**

**Gain experience digitizing selected items by using appropriate hardware and software**

**2b**

**Learn and utilize appropriate technology \(hardware and software for creation of raw image files and generation of file names and other metadata\) as indicated by DFW supervisor to create submission information for preservation/access repositories.**

**2c**

**The DFW participant should become proficient in the use of selected digitization hardware and software. Created raster image files will conform to the University of Washington’s standards for digital preservation, including conformance to some or all of the FADGI Technical Guidelines for Digitizing Cultural Heritage Materials.**

**3a**

**Gain experience preparing image files and metadata for digital preservation and access, in particular, for submission to the Hathi Trust and the UW Libraries’ local digital preservation repository service**

**3b**

**Gain an understanding of technical specifications for image files and metadata submitted to the Hathi Trust and UW Libraries’ digital preservation repository service. Organize, supplement \(if necessary\), and package page image files and all accompanying metadata according to specifications.**

**3c**

**Finalized submission information packages should meet criteria specified by the Hathi Trust and UW Libraries’ preservation repository service.**
