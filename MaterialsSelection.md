# Materials Selection

The raw materials that I’ll work with this quarter are government publications that have been referred to Preservation Services as part of what is referred to as the “brittle books program,” and looking over the materials that had been set aside for the project the concerns were immediately apparent.

The standard workflow for these materials when they enter Preservation Services is to perform a search to determine where else they are available, looking within the UW system, among fellow Orbis-Cascade member institutions, and elsewhere via an OCLC record search. During this process the availability of other editions and formats is also investigated.

Many of the materials set aside as potential candidates for digitization had already gone through this process, but a significant backlog had not. Because of this I was able to review pre-existing searching work and undergo a refresher course in searching using ExLibris Alma, the back-end ILS in use at UW, OCLC WorldCat, the Hathi Trust, and occasionally additional databases or platforms available via the UW Libraries website. 

While the standard searching workflow in preservation makes use of a paper form to track search results, it was helpful to aggregate this information, along with my comments on items, in a [spreadsheet*](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1Ko23klLYZBxVG8YzPaX33mD2GGJP4uCm62bc3HNvxUQ). This allowed me to share items queued for digitization and also share my progress with other project-related tasks, such as collating items in preparation for digital capture.

In addition to looking at the materials on my own, during the first three weeks of the quarter my site supervisor and I met twice with U.S. Documents Librarian Cass Hartnett. These meetings were extremely valuable and helpful in assessing the potential value of items to current and future users, introducing me to characteristics to look for in evaluating them, and giving a sense of the collecting scope for government publications at the University of Washington.
