# Flatbed Scanning  
Once discussions with my DFW supervisor and the U.S. Documents Librarian had resulted in a significant number of documents, I began work on the digitization of items, which actually consisted of a number of discrete subtasks. A large number of the documents selected for digitization were able to be captured using the flatbed scanner available in the Preservation Services Department.  
## Collation  
The first step in preparing volumes for digitization was a page count, including information about color, greyscale, and black and white pages, as well as pagination and other information.  
## FADGI Guidelines  
The <a href="http://www.digitizationguidelines.gov/guidelines/digitize-technical.html" target="blank">FADGI Technical Guidelines for Digitizing Cultural Heritage Materials</a> (approved September 2016) provided a specific set of practices for use in capturing selected materials and processing the resulting image files. These standards impose strict limits on the kinds of processing which can be performed on images, and scanning according to them differed from previous work in which I had used color adjustment and an image sharpening filter. 
### IrfanView  
Processing of images acquired using the flatbed was limited to cropping. The non-commercial freeware [IrfanView graphic viewer](https://www.irfanview.com/) proved an easy-to-use tool for this task as it allows for a number of kinds of batch processing for image files.  
# ATIZ Scanning
None of the government documents we selected for digitization as part of this project were bound, and so most were [captured using a flatbed scanner](FlatbedScanning.md). However, as I had hoped, a small number were put together in such a way that it made sense to capture them using the Preservation Services unit's Atiz BookDrive Mark II book scanner.
